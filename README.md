# Hangman Game
### Homework assignment 3 - create a hangman game utilizing JavaScript
Straightforward hangman game, but the appearance and words to be guessed are Harry Potter-themed. As of submission, this is the most JavaScript I have utilized in one project. It is heavily commented to aid in development, but also because I will be referring back to this project moving forward. If you hate comments, you best look away. The only jQuery used was to suspend the JavaScript file until the HTML finished loading. This is my first project using Bootstrap 4, so there is plenty of custom CSS to supplement the learning curve.
#### Skills Used
1. HTML/CSS
1. Bootstrap 4
